# Overview {closedTankEvaporation}

- Solver: [reactingTwoPhaseEulerFoam](\ref guide-applications-solvers-incompressible-pimpleFoam)
- Goals: 
  - Learn how to set up a multiphase simulation with thermally driven phase change under non-isobaric conditions
  - Understand the relevant submodels of drag, lift, heat and mass transfer on the constant/phaseProperties dictionary
  - 
  
- [Simulation](closedTankEvaporation)
  - example: pressure build-up during the boiling of water in a closed tank.
  
  
## Geometry

The geometry for this tutorial consists of a 2D cylinder. The mesh consists on a *wedge*.
